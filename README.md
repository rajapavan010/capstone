# Capstone Project
### 4. Evaluation
- *ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation)* scores are used to measure summarization accuracy.
- The evaluation results help determine the effectiveness of the model across different languages and sample sizes.

### 5. Visualization
- *Matplotlib and Seaborn* are used to generate insightful visualizations.
- Trends are analyzed to understand the impact of dataset size on summarization performance.
